# dotfiles

Your `dotfiles` are how you personalize your system. These are the base dotfiles that I start with when I set up a new environment (for more specific local needs I use the `*.local` files).

## Installation

If you're not me, please **do not** install dotfiles directly from this repo! Why? Because I often completely break this repo while updating.
